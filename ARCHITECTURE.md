# Gopher Workflow & Architecture

**Step-by-step explanation of Gopher's job lifecycle, architecture, and real-world usage**

---

## Core Architecture

### Components

| Component | Description | Role |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Server** | RESTful API | Accepts job submissions and provides status endpoints |
| **Worker** | Processing daemons | Execute jobs from queues with configurable concurrency |
| **CLI** | Command-line interface | Administrative tools and job management |
| **Redis** | Message broker | Central job storage, queue management, and communication |

---

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Job Submission

Clients submit jobs via HTTP API or CLI. Server validates the request, generates a unique job ID, and enqueues it in Redis.

```http
POST /api/jobs
{
  "type": "email",
  "payload": {
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Welcome!",
    "body": "Thank you for signing up."
  },
  "priority": "high",
  "retries": 3
}

Response:
{
  "job_id": "e52fe7d2-8be1-4d9f-a27d-2f02cb16ad00",
  "status": "enqueued"
}
```

### 2. Queue Management

#### Priority System
- **High Priority Queue**: Critical, time-sensitive jobs
- **Normal Priority Queue**: Standard business operations
- **Low Priority Queue**: Background tasks and maintenance

#### Scheduling
Delayed jobs are stored in Redis sorted sets for precise timing:
```bash
ZADD scheduled_jobs 1695916800 '{"job_id":"abc123","type":"reminder",...}'
```
### 3. Worker Processing

Workers implement a sophisticated polling mechanism:

1. **Priority-based polling** with configurable ratios (e.g., 3:2:1)
2. **Atomic job retrieval** preventing duplicate processing
3. **Handler routing** based on job type
4. **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff

```go
// Handler registration
registry.RegisterHandler("email", emailHandler)
registry.RegisterHandler("image_processing", imageHandler)
registry.RegisterHandler("data_export", exportHandler)
```

### 4. Job States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enqueued` | Job waiting in queue |
| `processing` | Currently being executed |
| `completed` | Successfully finished |
| `failed` | Failed after all retries |
| `scheduled` | Waiting for scheduled time |

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

#### Queue Health
- Queue depth by priority level
- Average wait time before processing
- Processing rate per worker

#### Performance
- Job execution time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Success and failure rates
- Worker utilization and throughput

#### System Health
- Redis connection status
- Worker pool capacity
- Memory and CPU usage

## Real-World Problem Solving

### Web Application Responsiveness

Offload blocking tasks to workers to improve response times:

```go
func SignupHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    client.SubmitJob("email", EmailPayload{
        To: newUser.Email,
        Subject: "Welcome!",
        Template: "welcome",
        Data: map[string]interface{}{ "username": newUser.Name },
    })
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)
}
```

### Microservice Coordination

Decoupled job submission for multi-service workflows:
1. Service A submits job
2. Worker executes
3. Another job enqueued to notify user
4. Worker processes notification

### Resource Management

- Priority queues ensure critical tasks first
- Rate limiting prevents overload
- Worker pools scale with system resources

### System Reliability

- Retries with exponential backoff
- DLQ stores jobs that exceed retries
- Operators can requeue after fixing issues

## Real-World Applications

### E-commerce Platform
```go
func ProcessOrderHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Submit multiple jobs for order processing
    client.SubmitJob("payment_processing", paymentData)
    client.SubmitJob("inventory_update", inventoryData)
    client.SubmitJob("order_confirmation_email", emailData)
    
    // Return immediately to user
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusAccepted)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{
        "status": "order_received",
        "order_id": orderID,
    })
}
```

### Media Processing Pipeline
- Video transcoding for multiple formats
- Thumbnail generation at various resolutions
- Metadata extraction and storage
- CDN distribution preparation

### Financial Services
- Transaction processing and validation
- Regulatory report generation
- Risk assessment calculations
- Customer notification workflows

## Technical Implementation

- Redis atomic operations: Exactly-once processing
- Worker pool pattern: Concurrency management
- Circuit breaker pattern: Fault tolerance
- Prometheus metrics: Real-time monitoring
- OpenTelemetry: Distributed tracing
